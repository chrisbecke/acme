Anode

Anode is a faithful-as-possible implementation of parts of node.js. Anode is implemented partially as a c++ static library and partially as templated classes.

Goals:
* Implicit memory management. Without garbage collection Anode is interesting. However I wish to avoid the smell that is explicit smart pointers and references.
